## 🔑 Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JustAsk.git
    cd JustAsk/app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `app/` directory. You can optionally add your API key here, but the app also supports entering it via the UI.
    ```env
    VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here  # Optional
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🗝️ API Key Configuration

To use the AI features, you need an **OpenRouter API Key**.
- If you don't provide one in the `.env` file, the application will prompt you to enter one securely upon launch.
- The key is stored locally in your browser (`localStorage`) and is never sent to our servers.
