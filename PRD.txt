# Product Requirements Document: Just Ask

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Just Ask  
**Type:** Hackathon Build (30-Hour Sprint)  
**Design Theme:** Neo-Brutalist / Pop-Art Academic  
**Problem Statement:** PS-05: Personalized Skill Gap Self-Diagnosis Tool  
**Core Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Gemini API

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Just Ask** is a goal-first career engine that reverses the traditional learning paradigm. Instead of navigating through endless course catalogs, students define a single career objective (e.g., "Full Stack Developer"). The platform conducts a rapid Binary Gap Analysis through an intuitive skill-sorting interface and generates a non-linear Metro Map roadmap. 

The system emphasizes action over passive consumption, tracking incremental progress through Micro-Wins displayed on a consistency heatmap. This approach helps users escape tutorial paralysis and focus on building practical skills.

## 2. Design System: Neo-Brutalist Architecture

The visual language prioritizes clarity, immediacy, and tactile interaction. The interface should feel like precision engineering—bold, intentional, and unmistakably functional.

### 2.1 Color Palette

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Canvas White | `#FFFFFF` | Backgrounds, empty states |
| Ink Black | `#000000` | Borders, typography, shadows |
| Action Red | `#FF4D4D` | Negative actions, blocked nodes, rejection states |
| Logic Blue | `#3B82F6` | Information states, hover effects, navigation |
| Highlighter Yellow | `#FFDE00` | Primary CTAs, affirmative actions, completed states |

### 2.2 Visual Design Rules

**Borders**
- All interactive elements require `border: 3px solid black`
- No rounded corners unless specifically noted

**Shadows**
- Hard shadows only: `box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px 0px #000`
- No blur or gradient effects

**Typography**
- **Headers:** Space Grotesk or Chivo (700-900 weight, -0.02em tracking)
- **Body:** JetBrains Mono (400-500 weight for code-like readability)
- **Scale:** Strict modular scale (16px base, 1.25 ratio)

**Micro-Interactions**
- Buttons depress on click via `transform: translateY(2px)` with shadow reduction
- Transitions use spring physics (via Framer Motion)
- Hover states shift from white to yellow backgrounds with maintained black borders

---

## 3. User Flow & Features

### Phase 1: Goal Input (Landing Page)

**Interface Design**
- Single large input field centered on viewport
- Minimal chrome, maximum focus
- Typewriter-style text rendering

**User Interaction**
1. User enters career goal: "I want to be a [Target Role]"
2. System parses input as user types
3. Visual feedback through subtle background pattern shift
4. Enter key triggers diagnosis engine initialization

**Technical Notes**
- Implement debounced parsing (300ms delay)
- Client-side validation for minimum input length
- Error state for unsupported career paths

---

### Phase 2: Skill Gap Analysis (Binary Sorting Interface)

**Objective:** Map user's existing knowledge in under 30 seconds

**UI Components**
- Centered card stack showing one skill at a time
- Clear left/right interaction zones
- Progress indicator showing X of 10 completed

**Interaction Mechanic**
- **Left Swipe (Red Zone):** "Learning Needed" → Added to roadmap as gap
- **Right Swipe (Yellow Zone):** "Already Know" → Excluded from roadmap
- Keyboard support: Arrow keys or A/D for accessibility

**Logic Flow**
1. Gemini API generates 10 foundational questions based on career goal
2. Questions ordered from fundamental to advanced
3. User responses stored as boolean array
4. Results feed into roadmap generation algorithm

**Card Design**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Skill: Python Loops    │
│                         │
│  Used to iterate over   │
│  collections and repeat │
│  code blocks            │
│                         │
│  [←] Don't Know  Know [→]│
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 3: Learning Roadmap (Metro Map Visualization)

**UI Pattern:** Horizontal scrollable subway/metro map metaphor

**Node States**
- **White Node:** Locked (dependencies incomplete)
- **Yellow Node:** Active/In Progress
- **Blue Node:** Completed

**Edge System**
- Thick black connector lines between nodes
- Branching supported for parallel learning paths
- Example: "Learn CSS" branches to "Flexbox" and "Grid"

**Node Interaction (Modal)**
When clicking a node, display ticket-style modal containing:

1. **Context (The "Why"):** Single sentence explaining skill relevance
2. **Action Item:** Project-based task (Build X, not Watch Y)
3. **Submission Zone:** Drag-and-drop area for proof of completion
4. **Estimated Time:** Realistic completion timeframe

**Example Node Structure**
```javascript
{
  "id": "node_js_async",
  "title": "Asynchronous JavaScript",
  "why": "APIs don't wait around—neither should your code.",
  "task": "Build a weather app that fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API",
  "estimated_hours": 4,
  "dependencies": ["node_js_fetch", "node_js_promises"],
  "status": "locked"
}
```

---

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking (Heatmap Dashboard)

**Profile Card Design**
- Trading card aesthetic with user stats
- Compact, scannable layout
- Achievement-oriented copy

**Consistency Heatmap**
- GitHub contribution graph pattern
- Tracks intensity of engagement, not just login frequency
- Color progression:
  - White: No activity
  - Light Yellow: Consumption (reading/watching)
  - Yellow: Moderate engagement (building, submitting)
  - Blue: High engagement (multiple completions)

**Key Metrics**
- **Current Streak:** Consecutive active days
- **Primary Skill:** Most completed nodes in category
- **Total Projects:** Completed task count
- **Velocity:** Average completion rate (nodes/week)

---

### 4.2 Backend Infrastructure (Firebase)

**Authentication Strategy**
- Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0 popup flow)
- Anonymous authentication for demo mode
- Account linking for anonymous-to-permanent conversion

**Firestore Database Schema**

**Collection: `users`**
```javascript
{
  "uid": "user_abc123",
  "displayName": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "currentStreak": 4,
  "longestStreak": 12,
  "totalProjects": 7,
  "heatmapData": {
    "2024-01-15": 3,  // Intensity level 0-4
    "2024-01-16": 1,
    "2024-01-17": 4
  }
}
```

**Collection: `roadmaps` (subcollection under users)**
```javascript
{
  "roadmapId": "rm_fullstack_2024",
  "userId": "user_abc123",
  "careerGoal": "Full Stack Developer",
  "status": "active",  // active, completed, archived
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "lastUpdated": "timestamp",
  "knownSkills": ["html", "css", "javascript-basics"],
  "gapSkills": ["react", "nodejs", "sql"],
  "nodes": [
    {
      "nodeId": "node_001",
      "title": "JavaScript Variables & Data Types",
      "status": "completed",
      "type": "project",
      "completedAt": "timestamp"
    },
    {
      "nodeId": "node_002",
      "title": "Build a Calculator",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "type": "project",
      "startedAt": "timestamp"
    },
    {
      "nodeId": "node_003",
      "title": "React State Management",
      "status": "locked",
      "type": "project",
      "dependencies": ["node_001", "node_002"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security Rules**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      match /roadmaps/{roadmapId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.3 AI Integration Layer (Gemini API)

**Roadmap Generation Strategy**

**Prompt Engineering Pattern: One-Shot JSON Generation**

```
System Prompt:
You are a career architect specializing in technical skill development. 
Create a structured learning roadmap for a {CAREER_GOAL}. 

User Knowledge Base:
- Already knows: {KNOWN_SKILLS}
- Learning gaps: {GAP_SKILLS}

Requirements:
1. Generate exactly 8-12 nodes focusing ONLY on gap skills
2. Each node must include:
   - title: Clear, specific skill name
   - microTask: Concrete project to build (no tutorials)
   - whyText: One sentence explaining practical relevance
   - estimatedHours: Realistic completion time
   - dependencies: Array of prerequisite node IDs
3. Output valid JSON only, no markdown formatting
4. Ensure logical progression from foundational to advanced
5. Include at least one capstone project combining multiple skills

Output Format:
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "nodeId": "string",
      "title": "string",
      "microTask": "string",
      "whyText": "string",
      "estimatedHours": number,
      "dependencies": ["string"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**API Implementation**
```javascript
async function generateRoadmap(careerGoal, knownSkills, gapSkills) {
  const prompt = buildPrompt(careerGoal, knownSkills, gapSkills);
  
  const response = await fetch('https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro:generateContent', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${GEMINI_API_KEY}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      contents: [{ parts: [{ text: prompt }] }],
      generationConfig: {
        temperature: 0.7,
        maxOutputTokens: 2048,
      }
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return JSON.parse(data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text);
}
```

## 5. Hackathon MVP Scope (30-Hour Constraints)

### Feature Prioritization

**In Scope (Must Have)**
- Single goal input and parsing
- 10-question skill gap analysis
- Metro map visualization with fixed layout
- Basic node interaction and status updates
- Heatmap progress tracking
- Google authentication

**Out of Scope (Future Iterations)**
- Dynamic graph layout algorithm (use fixed snake pattern)
- AI-powered proof verification (accept any upload, auto-approve after 2s delay)
- Multiple concurrent roadmaps (limit to one active goal)
- Social features and leaderboards
- Mobile-responsive optimization beyond basic breakpoints
- Internationalization

### Implementation Shortcuts

**1. Fixed Layout System**
```javascript
// Hardcoded node positions for 12-node roadmap
const METRO_LAYOUT = [
  { x: 100, y: 200, id: 'node_001' },
  { x: 250, y: 200, id: 'node_002' },
  { x: 400, y: 200, id: 'node_003' },
  // ... continue snake pattern
];
```

**2. Mock Verification Flow**
```javascript
async function submitProof(file) {
  // Simulate upload
  await delay(2000);
  
  // Auto-approve without actual AI check
  return { verified: true, message: "Proof accepted!" };
}
```

**3. Simplified State Machine**
- Nodes can only be: locked → in_progress → completed
- No partial completion or revision states
- Linear dependency chains only (no complex DAGs)

---

## 6. Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

**Speed Metrics**
- Time to roadmap generation: Target < 60 seconds from landing
- Skill assessment completion rate: Target 100% (all 10 questions answered)
- Average session duration: Target > 5 minutes

**Engagement Metrics**
- Node completion rate: % of unlocked nodes completed within 7 days
- Return user rate: % of users who log in 2+ times
- Streak establishment: % of users who achieve 3+ day streak

### Qualitative Metrics (Judging Criteria)

**Visual Impact**
- Does the neo-brutalist design create immediate recognition?
- Is the interface intuitive without onboarding?

**Value Proposition Clarity**
- Do judges understand the "reverse learning" concept within 30 seconds?
- Is the Metro Map metaphor immediately clear?

**Technical Execution**
- Smooth interactions with no lag on card swipes
- Proper state management (no data loss on refresh)
- Clean, production-ready code structure
