# Just Ask - Comprehensive Feature Ecosystem
*State as of Feb 2026 - The Infrastructure & Social Update*

## 1. Goal-First Intelligence
- **Typewriter Console**: A focused, minimalist input terminal. Type your career goal (e.g., "Fullstack Developer") and watch Gemini architect your path.
- **Dynamic Atmosphere**: The background shifts based on the time of day, creating a "live workspace" feel. HSL-tailored colors ensure high readability in both dawn and dusk modes.

## 2. Skill Trap (Cognitive Assessment)
- **Swipe Diagnosis**: A rapid-fire "Tinder" interface for skills. Gemini generates specific domain questions based on your goal; you swipe left for "Unknown" or right for "Known".
- **Intelligent Branching**: The assessment doesn't just list skills—it structures them. Known skills are marked as 'Skipped' in your roadmap, while gaps are highlighted for immediate focus.

## 3. Metro Map (The Visual Backbone)
- **Transit-Style Canvas**: Your roadmap is visualized as an infinite, zoomable Metro Map. Milestones are "Tracks", and specific topics are "Stations".
- **Zero-Overlap Architecture**: An intelligent radial stacking algorithm Ensures that even complex goals with 50+ tasks stay readable and clutter-free.
- **milestone Lifecycle**: Nodes transition through states: `Locked` (requires prerequisite), `Active` (current focus), and `Completed` (verified).

## 4. Execution Dashboard (Getting Things Done)
- **Next Up Panel**: A persistent "Quick-Action" widget on your dashboard that highlights the top 3 immediate tasks across your entire roadmap. One-click access to start learning.
- **Today's Quest**: A slide-out checklist for daily sessions. Includes a progress bar and completion "Trophies" to keep momentum high.
- **Task Thread View**: A deep-dive modal for every task including:
    - **The Breakdown**: AI-generated conceptual explanations.
    - **Practice Field**: Real-world questions and hints to test your knowledge.
    - **Resource Vault**: Curated links and documentation for deep study.
- **Evidence Vault**: Users can save "Proof of Work" (links, notes, files) for every task, creating a permanent portfolio of their learning journey.

## 5. Roadmap Exchange (Social Infrastructure)
- **The Community Hub**: A real-time, searchable network of human-curated learning paths.
- **Real-time Sync**: Using Firebase `onSnapshot`, new roadmaps, votes, and "Steals" appear instantly for all users.
- **Social Forking (Stealing)**: 
    - Found a great path? "Steal" it to add it to your profile.
    - **Lineage (Provenance)**: Forked roadmaps permanently credit the original author (e.g., *"Forked from Shadow Dev"*).
- **Engagement ecosystem**: 
    - **Community Voting**: High-contrast upvote/downvote system with global persistence.
    - **Discovery Tools**: Search by keywords and sort by "NEW", "TOP", or "POPS" (Trending).

## 6. The Goal Drive (Management)
- **Industrial Sidebar**: Sessions are managed as "Cartridge Disks".
- **Status Lights**: Real-time LED-style indicators (Green for Active, Red for Missed Deadlines).
- **Goal Cobwebs**: Over time, inactive roadmaps develop visual "cobwebs" in the sidebar, a subtle nudge to resume your abandoned goals.
- **Persistent Cloud**: Every action is synced to a personal Firebase Cloud profile, ensuring zero data loss across devices.

## 7. Profile & Gamification
- **Trading Card Identity**: A high-fidelity profile card featuring:
    - **The Streak**: Consecutive days of "Deep Work".
    - **Velocity**: Tasks completed per week.
    - **Yellow Heatmap**: A monochrome yellow activity grid tracking your consistency across the year.
- **Time Tracking**: Logged minutes are aggregated into your global stats, measuring raw effort alongside milestones.

## 8. Technical Architecture
- **Tech Stack**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind (Custom Neo-Brutalist Config), Zustand (Atomic Store), Firebase (Real-time NoSQL & Auth), Framer Motion (120fps UI).
- **AI Core**: Gemini Pro 1.5 - Orchestrates the initial goal analysis, assessment generation, and roadmap content.
